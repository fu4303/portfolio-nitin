# Form meets code

Hi, I am Nitin Tulswani. I am a web developer currently working at <ExternalLink href="https://bulb.co.uk/"> Bulb Energy</ExternalLink>
based in London. I plan to use this space as a medium to share all of my
learnings, projects and the creative process.

I do a lot of creative coding, and love working with Processing. You can see my growing collection of sketches <Link to="/sketches" renderGatsbyLink className="text-blue-400">here</Link>.

I take a lot of photos. Some of my favourites are hosted <ExternalLink href="https://unsplash.com/@nitintulswani">on Unsplash</ExternalLink>.

You can get in touch with me on Twitter <ExternalLink href="https://twitter.com/NTulswani">@NTulswani</ExternalLink> where I mostly share things about my work, or reach out through <Link to="mailto:tulswani19@gmail.com">email</Link>.

Thank you for visiting!
