## Introduction

Moiré pattern is a geometrical design which is produced when a set of lines or pattern is overlaid onto an another set.

Below is an interactive canvas that shows four instances of <Link to="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConcentricCircles.html">concentric circles</Link>
overlaid onto each other. Alongside, there is a list of properties that determine how all the circles are rendered when their values are changed.
