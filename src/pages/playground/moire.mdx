    Moiré pattern

## Introduction

Moiré pattern is a geometrical design which is produced when a set of lines or a pattern is overlaid onto an another set.

<FlexContainer centerAlign className="pt-5 pb-5">
  <img src={moireImage} alt="" />
</FlexContainer>

A good example of the Moiré pattern is the stripes appearing in an image taken using a digital camera. When an image sensor's pattern matches the pattern of the image subject, it produces a moire.

<FlexContainer centerAlign className="pt-5 pb-5">
  <img src={moireExample} alt="" />
</FlexContainer>

## Creating custom patterns using Moiré

Using Moiré, we can create custom patterns by controlling how two patterns / shapes overlay onto each other.

Below is an interactive canvas that shows four instances of concentric circles overlaid onto each other. Alongside, there is a list of properties that determine how all the circles are rendered when their values are changed.

Try changing the values and hover over the canvas. Moving the cursor on the canvas either in horizontal or vertical direction will produce a different image.

<Canvas />

## Properties

The above canvas renders the image using these three properties:

- Stroke offset - The stroke offset property determines the stroke value of each circle.

- Circle size - This property sets the radii for circle in each instance of concentric circle.

- Stroke weight offset - This property sets the stroke weight for each circle
